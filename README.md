# In this tutorial we will be building two facial expression classifiers from a labelled dataset FER2013. We will be using a Multi-Layer perceptron model (MLP) and CNN-based model to perform the classification. 

## Install necessary python packages 

Run the below commands if these packages are not installed in your system. 

- pip install pandas
- pip install torch
- pip install -U scikit-learn

For visualisation
